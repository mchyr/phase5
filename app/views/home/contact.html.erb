		<p>Unfortunately, the Amazing &amp; Marvelous Creamery is not a real business, but 
			rather a course project for programming students at Carnegie Mellon University. We 
			are sure that you wanted to taste our delicious ice cream and even get a job working  
			for the best company on the planet, but that's how it goes sometimes.  If you are 
			bitterly disappointed (and quite honestly, you should be) and want to 
			grouse to someone, here's the contact info:</p>
