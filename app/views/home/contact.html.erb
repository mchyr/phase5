<p>	Unfortunately, the Creamery
 is not a real dessert website, but rather a sample project for noob students
 like me at Carnegie Mellon University. We are sure that you wanted to try exceptional
 desserts and ice cream flavors from the most exquisite creamery on the planet, but
 that's how it goes sometimes.  If you are bitterly disappointed (and quite honestly,
 you should be) and want to grouse to someone, here's the contact info:</p>

<p class="note"><br>*I am a student studying information systems at Carnegie Mellon 
	University and this project is to show my introductory skills in application
	design and development. I believe simplicity is the best way to effectively display
	information. Do not hate on the simplicity of my site.
